# unipay-client
Set of integration tools, which simplify integration with UniPay Payment Gateway (http://unipaygateway.com ).   UniPay Gateway is a popular open source payment gateway, which is used by numerous merchants and payment service providers.   This project is our attempt to simplify the efforts associated with integration of front-end applications (websites, CRMs, etc) with the core UniPay Gateway server.  This library simplifies programming for people who need to process credit card transactions, ACH transactions, setup recurring billing payments, and manage subscription billing.  Please be advised that usage of the library may put your application in PCI scope, depending on the way you will consume the functionality and data that you are going to pass.
